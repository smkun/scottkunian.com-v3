# Firebase Admin Security Implementation ✅

## Overview

This project now implements **production-ready Firebase admin role security** using custom claims. Only users with the `admin: true` custom claim can access the admin panel and modify content.

## Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETE

### ✅ What's Implemented

1. **Real Admin Verification** - `src/lib/auth.ts`
   - `isAdmin(user)` - Checks Firebase custom claims
   - `getUserClaims(user)` - Retrieves all custom claims
   - `refreshUserToken(user)` - Forces token refresh for updated claims

2. **Frontend Protection** - `src/components/auth/ProtectedRoute.tsx`
   - `AdminRoute` component enforces admin claim check
   - Shows "Access Denied" for authenticated non-admins
   - Automatic loading states during admin verification

3. **Backend Enforcement** - `firestore.rules`
   - All write operations require `request.auth.token.admin == true`
   - Deployed to Firebase: `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules` ✅

4. **Admin Setup Tools**
   - `scripts/setAdminClaim.js` - One-time setup script
   - `docs/ADMIN_SETUP.md` - Comprehensive setup guide

## Next Steps: Admin Access Setup

### To Enable Admin Access (One-Time Setup)

**Current State**: Implementation complete, but no user has admin claims yet.

**Required Action**: Set admin claim for `scottkunian@gmail.com`

**Instructions**: See [`docs/ADMIN_SETUP.md`](docs/ADMIN_SETUP.md) for detailed steps.

**Quick Setup**:
1. Download Firebase service account key from [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/scottkunian-website/settings/serviceaccounts/adminsdk)
2. Save as `firebase-service-account.json` in project root
3. Run: `node scripts/setAdminClaim.js`
4. Sign out and sign in again in the app

## Security Benefits

### Before
- ❌ Any Google account could access admin panel
- ❌ Placeholder security with no enforcement
- ❌ Not production-ready

### After
- ✅ Only authorized admin (scottkunian@gmail.com) has access
- ✅ Token-based verification on frontend and backend
- ✅ Firestore rules enforce admin claims server-side
- ✅ Production-ready security architecture

## Files Modified

- [`src/lib/auth.ts`](src/lib/auth.ts) - Admin verification functions
- [`src/components/auth/ProtectedRoute.tsx`](src/components/auth/ProtectedRoute.tsx) - AdminRoute enforcement
- [`firestore.rules`](firestore.rules) - Admin claim validation (deployed ✅)
- [`scripts/setAdminClaim.js`](scripts/setAdminClaim.js) - Setup script (new)
- [`docs/ADMIN_SETUP.md`](docs/ADMIN_SETUP.md) - Setup guide (new)

## Testing Admin Access

Once admin claim is set:

1. Sign in at `/admin/login` with `scottkunian@gmail.com`
2. Navigate to `/admin` - should see admin dashboard
3. Test with different Google account - should see "Access Denied"

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Still seeing "Access Denied" after running setup script

**Solution**: Sign out completely and sign in again. Custom claims are cached in ID tokens and require a fresh login to update.

**Issue**: Script fails with "service account not found"

**Solution**: Download the service account key from Firebase Console and save as `firebase-service-account.json` in project root.
